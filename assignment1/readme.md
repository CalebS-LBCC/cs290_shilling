My goal for the final project is to pull information from a backend and display it while giving
users the ability to interact with the backend. This likely will take the form of a shopping app
where the user will search the website, which will then display and image of the item along with
their name and price, then have the ability to "purchase" the item.

The backend will contain ~20 items and images and be easily expandable, so a search bar will be
needed. I aim to have the search bar, part of a greater top bar, move along with the webpage.
Some items will be contained within menus in the top bar, and some will be on the main page as
promotions.

The front page will be filled only with promotions and links to items, with some greater sizes
than others. When searching for an item, all items that appear will be the same size in the list
and have the image of the item on the left with the name of the item on top and the price on the
bottom, all aligned left alongside the image.

The item page itself will contain the item, price, and image alongside a "buy" icon. This will
place the item in a shopping cart, which then can be bought from another page. The shopping cart
page will have the name of the object hyperlinked to its page alongside the price with a total
with a purchase button. Purchase will clear the cart and say something thanking the user for the
purchase.

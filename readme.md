5 Websites:

OSU CoE Website
https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/
The OSU College of Engineering website is a mess, to put it lightly. Information on specific degrees is located under the "Academic" tab which really
should be labled "Programs" instead. The website is less of an informational tool for prospective students and more of a way to advertise the program
itself. I personally still don't know how to navigate it to get the information I need.

LBCC Website
https://www.linnbenton.edu/
The new LBCC website is alright but it does prioritize looks over ease-of-use. The website is far more functional than the OSU website, though and even
looks far nicer than it too. I do miss the old schedule of classes where the number of clicks needed to find a class was minimal, but the new one works
alright for what it is.

CNN
https://www.cnn.com/
CNN is my news website of choice simply because of how easy-to-navigate it is and, despite being simplistic, has little clutter and actually looks better
than the likes of MSNBC and Fox. Text might be a little close together making it feel overly-dense, so I would recommend spacing out text vertically a
bit.

Amazon
https://www.amazon.com/
While I do like the Amazon website, there are a few things that could be improved. The search bar and upper banner scrolls with the page, so fixing it to
the top always would make using the website easier. I do like how little of the screen the top bar takes up, it makes searching for something easier.

Youtube
https://www.youtube.com/
It is clear that Youtube has had a decade of constant work done to it: the interface is easy to understand but still has a lot of functionality. The search
bar scrolls with the page, the side bar has links to various genres, and settings are easy to access with a single button. The settings on the top bar
could also be marked with a gear like how it is on the sidebar if you scroll down, but everything makes sense layout-wise and looks good.
